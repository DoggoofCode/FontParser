# FONT PARSER 
#### Final Parser
## Goals
The goals for this project is to reliably parse from the font files the following information:
- Font name
- Font style
- Font Data

After Parsing the data the goal is to use bezier-curves to draw the font on the screen. Following that the goal will be 
to use triangles to simply fill in the font.

## Plans for Next Commit
- Add more to the vector type to allow for more operations
- Get the font table and offset table to work reliably
- Find the endian method of the TTF files
